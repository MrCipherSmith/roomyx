# Review: Performance (Code-Level Bottlenecks)

## Purpose

Finds real, code-level performance problems introduced in the changed code of the current branch. Covers N+1 database queries, unnecessary React re-renders, missing memoization in hot paths, memory leaks, large bundle imports, synchronous blocking in async contexts, missing pagination, and redundant API calls.

This skill focuses on **measurable or high-likelihood bottlenecks** only. Premature optimization, hypothetical slowness, and style preferences are out of scope.

## Scope Detection

See shared script: `skills/shared/git-merge-base.md`

Run the script from that file to determine `MERGE_BASE` (`BASE_SHA`) and `SCOPE` before proceeding.

### Commands to collect the review slice

```bash
git status
git log --oneline "${BASE_SHA}..HEAD"
git diff --stat --name-status "${BASE_SHA}..HEAD"
git diff "${BASE_SHA}..HEAD"

# Include uncommitted changes (default mode):
git diff --stat --name-status "${BASE_SHA}"
git diff "${BASE_SHA}"
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

For explicit hash/range mode:

```bash
git diff --stat --name-status <FROM_SHA>..<TO_SHA>
git diff <FROM_SHA>..<TO_SHA>
```

## Review Checklist

Work through every category below for each changed file. Tie every finding to a concrete line in the diff. For each finding, state **the hot path or execution frequency** that makes it a real problem — without that, it is INFO only.

### 1. N+1 Database Queries

**Detection patterns:**
- [ ] Loop or `.map()` containing a DB query, repository call, or Prisma/TypeORM find
- [ ] `for (const item of items) { await repo.findOne(...) }` — classic N+1
- [ ] ORM relation accessed without eager loading inside iteration: `order.items` where `items` is a lazy relation loaded inside a loop
- [ ] GraphQL resolver loading a child relation per parent without a DataLoader

**Correct patterns to confirm:**
- Prisma: `include` / `select` on the parent query to fetch relations in one round trip
- TypeORM: `createQueryBuilder().leftJoinAndSelect()` or `findOptions.relations`
- MikroORM: `populate` option
- Raw SQL: `JOIN` rather than a secondary query per row

**Hot path requirement:** State whether this runs per HTTP request, per list item render, per job iteration, etc.

### 2. Unnecessary React Re-renders

**Detection patterns:**
- [ ] Object or array literal created inline in JSX: `<Component options={{ key: val }} />` — new reference every render
- [ ] Arrow function created inline as prop: `<Button onClick={() => store.doX()} />` — new reference every render
- [ ] Large expensive computation performed directly in render body (not in useMemo)
- [ ] Context value object created inline without useMemo: `<MyContext.Provider value={{ a, b }}>` — every parent render triggers all consumers
- [ ] Component receiving a new object/array reference from props despite same data (parent not memoizing)

**When memo IS justified (flag absence):**
- [ ] Pure child component receiving stable props but not wrapped in `React.memo` — only flag if the parent re-renders frequently (e.g., on keypress, scroll, animation frame)
- [ ] `useCallback` absent for a callback passed to a `React.memo` child — only flag if the child is expensive

**MobX note:** With MobX + observer, `useCallback`/`useMemo` are rarely needed. Do NOT flag their absence unless there is concrete evidence of re-render cost. Flag only missing `observer()` (see `review-frontend` for full MobX checklist).

### 3. Expensive Computations in Hot Paths

- [ ] Sorting, filtering, or reducing a large array inside a render function without `useMemo`
- [ ] Deep clone (`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))`) inside a loop or on every render
- [ ] Regex compilation inside a loop — should be compiled once outside: `const RE = /pattern/`
- [ ] `Object.keys().reduce()` or similar aggregation recalculated on every render instead of being derived in store or memoized
- [ ] Recursive computation without memoization called in a loop

**Hot path requirement:** An expensive computation is only a `major` finding if it runs at render time or in a tight loop. A one-time computation at load time is `info` at most.

### 4. Missing Database Indexes

Detectable from query patterns in changed code (not from DB schema directly):

- [ ] New query filtering on a column that is not a primary key and not obviously indexed: `WHERE email = ?` without a unique constraint visible in the schema or migration
- [ ] `ORDER BY created_at DESC` on a table with potentially large row counts — `created_at` index not evident
- [ ] `LIKE '%term%'` — prefix wildcard prevents index use; flag as info with suggestion to use full-text search
- [ ] Foreign key column used in JOIN without an index (common ORM footgun)

**Evidence requirement:** Cannot confirm an index is missing without seeing the migration or schema. If schema is not in the diff, downgrade to `minor` and note that the reviewer should check the schema.

### 5. Memory Leaks

**Event listeners and subscriptions:**
- [ ] `addEventListener` without matching `removeEventListener` in cleanup
- [ ] `setInterval` / `setTimeout` (recurring) without `clearInterval` / `clearTimeout` in cleanup
- [ ] RxJS `subscribe()` without `unsubscribe()` stored in a disposable or returned from useEffect cleanup
- [ ] MobX `autorun` / `reaction` / `when` without disposer called in `dispose()` (see `review-frontend` for full checklist)
- [ ] WebSocket or SSE connection opened without close in cleanup

**React useEffect:**
- [ ] `useEffect` that creates a subscription, timer, or async operation but returns no cleanup function

**Unbounded collections:**
- [ ] Map, Set, or array that grows on every event/request with no eviction, max size, or TTL
- [ ] Cache object that accumulates entries indefinitely: `const cache = {}; cache[key] = value`
- [ ] Growing error log array or history buffer without a max length

**Node.js / Server:**
- [ ] `EventEmitter` with `on()` inside a request handler — new listener per request, no removal
- [ ] `process.on('uncaughtException', ...)` registered multiple times (inside a function called per request)

### 6. Large Bundle Imports

- [ ] Default import of a large library when only one function is needed: `import _ from 'lodash'` instead of `import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'`
- [ ] `import * as Icons from '@mui/icons-material'` — imports entire icon tree
- [ ] `import { something } from 'date-fns'` — this is correct (tree-shakeable); flag `import dateFns from 'date-fns'`
- [ ] Side-effect imports pulling in large polyfills unnecessarily
- [ ] Dynamic `import()` inside a render function or tight loop (re-creates module promise)

**Evidence requirement:** Only flag if the library is known to be large (lodash, moment, antd, @mui). For unfamiliar libraries, flag as `info`.

### 7. Synchronous Blocking in Async Contexts

- [ ] `fs.readFileSync` / `fs.writeFileSync` inside a request handler or async function
- [ ] `child_process.execSync` in a Node.js server handler
- [ ] CPU-intensive synchronous computation (sorting large arrays, JSON.parse of large payloads) in an Express/NestJS handler without offloading to a worker
- [ ] `new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, N))` — artificial sleep in a server handler
- [ ] Synchronous DB client used in an async context (e.g., `better-sqlite3` in an Express handler serving concurrent requests)

### 8. Missing Pagination

- [ ] Repository query with no `take`/`limit` on a collection that could grow (user-generated content, logs, history)
- [ ] `findAll()` / `find({})` with no limit on a table mentioned as potentially large in context
- [ ] API endpoint returning an array without `page`/`cursor`/`limit` parameters when the underlying data is unbounded

**Evidence requirement:** Only flag as `major` if the dataset is described as large or clearly unbounded. For small controlled datasets, flag as `minor`.

### 9. Redundant API Calls

- [ ] Same endpoint fetched multiple times in the same render cycle or component tree without caching
- [ ] Two sibling components each fetching the same data independently instead of sharing state / lifting to parent store
- [ ] `useEffect` with a dependency array that triggers refetch on every render due to non-primitive dependency (object identity)
- [ ] Polling without deduplication when multiple component instances are mounted

### 10. MobX: Derived State Computed in Renders

- [ ] Value derived from observables computed inline in a component: `const total = store.items.reduce(...)` — should be `@computed get total()` in the store
- [ ] Filtered list recalculated in render: `store.items.filter(x => x.active)` — should be a `@computed`
- [ ] Conditional format derived from observable in render instead of a computed getter

## Iron Laws

### Shared laws (every reviewer)

1. **A claim of runtime harm with no reproducible path is `info`.** If you cannot
   name the input, call, or condition that reaches the code, you have an
   observation, not a finding. Report it as `info` and say what would settle it.
2. **Never flag the theoretical.** The path you describe must exist in the code
   under review. Do not report a safe API because it could be misused, or a
   pattern because it is often wrong elsewhere.
3. **One finding per class, not one per occurrence.** When the same shape appears
   at several sites, report it once and list every site. Ten findings that are one
   finding hide the other nine problems.

Severity levels are defined once, in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md` →
**Severity (canonical)**. This reviewer does not restate them: `blocker` is the
four merge-blocking shapes named there and nothing else, and the `major`/`minor`
boundary is the trigger-and-outcome test.

### Performance laws

1. **Every `blocker` or `major` finding MUST cite the specific hot path or
   frequency that makes it a real problem.** "Runs on every keystroke", "called
   per list item (N = potentially thousands)", "executes on every render of a
   high-frequency parent" — be specific. For this reviewer, the execution
   frequency *is* the trigger shared law 1 asks for.
2. **Do not flag patterns outside the diff.** Review only changed code. Legacy
   issues outside the diff are `info` at most, with a note to track separately.

---

## Output Contract

### Class scope — required for `blocker` and `major`

Every `blocker` and `major` finding must carry `class_scope`: **every** site that
holds the shape you found, and **how you enumerated them** — the grep or query
you ran, or the guard that derives the set.

A finding anchored to one `file:line` is a claim about one site. The recorded
history of this repository is that a fix then repairs that site and leaves its
siblings: one writer of five, one operator instruction of four, six readers of
eight. Each was found by the *next* review round, which is why reviews here have
run to seven and four rounds instead of one.

```yaml
class_scope:
  sites: ["src/lib/shell-config.ts:60", "src/session/store.ts:133"]
  enumeration_method: "grep for the config-path resolvers; 7 writers, 2 unguarded"
```

"I checked the others" is not an enumeration method. A single-entry `sites` list
is a claim that the class has exactly one member — make it deliberately, because
`review-finding.schema.json` accepts it and the next round tests it.

`minor` and `info` may omit it: enumerating the class for every low-severity
observation is theatre, not rigour.

### Status line (first line of response)

```
STATUS: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | NEEDS_CONTEXT | BLOCKED
```

- `DONE` — review complete, findings (if any) are below
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — one or more `blocker` or `major` findings found
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — cannot assess severity without additional context (e.g., expected dataset size, render frequency not determinable from diff alone)
- `BLOCKED` — cannot run git commands or access the repo

### Report structure

```markdown

### Where performance conditions land

Severity comes from **Severity (canonical)** in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md`.
This reviewer keeps no table of its own; what follows is where its recurring
conditions land under that rubric, not a second rubric.

| Condition | Severity | Why, under the canonical rubric |
|---|---|---|
| A cost that takes the process or request down — OOM, timeout, capacity exhausted at a stated load | `blocker` | Crash |
| Bottleneck on a path you can name, with the frequency or data scale that makes it a cost | `major` | Trigger and outcome are both named; slow is not one of the four shapes |
| Inefficiency off any hot path you can name | `minor` | Correct today; the cost is to whoever tunes it next |
| "Looks slow", no execution context | `info` | Shared law 1 — no reproducible path |

A performance finding is `blocker` only when the degradation *is* an outage.
"Noticeably degrades UX" is `major`: real, named, and not merge-blocking.

---

## Red Flags Table

Stop and re-read these rules if you are thinking:

| Rationalization | Why it's wrong |
|---|---|
| "This loop iterates over user data, so N+1 is obviously a problem" | State the expected N and query cost; "user data" is not self-evidently large |
| "I'll flag this as major because it looks slow" | Looking slow is not a hot path; cite the execution context |
| "Missing useMemo here is a performance issue" | useMemo has overhead; only flag when the computation is measurably expensive or the component re-renders at high frequency |
| "I'll add a minor finding for every lodash default import" | Correct — but only flag if the library is large and the import is demonstrably not tree-shaken |
| "The dataset could grow large, so I'll call it a blocker" | "Could grow" = minor or info; known to be large = major or blocker |
| "Skipping the hot-path citation to keep the finding concise" | Performance law 1: the hot path is mandatory for blocker/major; omitting it means downgrading to `info` |

## Job Context Awareness

When dispatched by `job-orchestrator` or `review-orchestrator` as part of a job pipeline, the prompt MAY include:

```
JOB_NAME:     <job-name>
CONTEXT_PATH: <JOBS_ROOT>/<job-name>/ai/context.md
```

If provided and the file exists, read the context document before starting the review. Use it to:
- Understand expected dataset sizes and traffic patterns documented for the project
- Identify ORM and caching strategies already in place (avoid flagging already-cached paths)
- Understand which MobX patterns and React memo conventions the project follows
- Avoid flagging intentional trade-offs (e.g., a known small dataset where pagination is explicitly deferred)

If the file does not exist or is not provided, proceed normally — context is optional and non-blocking.


## Orchestrated Review Contract

When dispatched by `review-orchestrator`, follow the provided `reviewer-input.schema.json` payload. Return a `REVIEW_RESULT` object compatible with `skills/review/review-orchestrator/reviewer-finding.schema.json`, then a concise markdown summary. Keep findings evidence-based, include concrete `suggested_fix` for every blocker/major, and return `NEEDS_CONTEXT` instead of guessing when required context is missing.
