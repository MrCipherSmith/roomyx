# Review Architecture

Specialized reviewer for **architectural patterns and structural decisions**.
Reviews only changes introduced in the current branch (merge-base to HEAD).
Focuses exclusively on verifiable structural violations — not style opinions or hypothetical concerns.

---

## Workflow

```
Architecture Review Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Read Job Context (if provided) — understand intentional stack choices
- [ ] Step 2: Determine git scope (merge-base)
- [ ] Step 3: Collect diff and changed file list
- [ ] Step 4: Identify stack (NestJS, React+MobX, generic TS, mixed)
- [ ] Step 5: Check layer assignments and dependency direction
- [ ] Step 6: Check module/provider boundaries
- [ ] Step 7: Check design pattern correctness (Repository, DI, MVVM)
- [ ] Step 8: Check SOLID violations
- [ ] Step 9: Check framework-specific concerns (NestJS / React / MobX)
- [ ] Step 10: Emit findings in unified format
```

## Input Contract

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `branch` | string | no | Branch to review. Defaults to current branch. |
| `commit_range` | string | no | Explicit hash or range. Overrides merge-base detection. |
| `context_doc` | string | no | Path to job context document. Read before reviewing to understand intentional decisions. |
| `stack_hint` | string | no | Optional hint: `nestjs`, `react-mobx`, `generic-ts`. Reviewer auto-detects if absent. |

---

## Scope Detection

See shared script: `skills/shared/git-merge-base.md`

Run the script to determine `BASE_SHA`, then collect the diff:

```bash
# Changed files — used for stack auto-detection
git diff --name-status "${BASE_SHA}"

# Full diff — used for finding exact violations
git diff "${BASE_SHA}"

# Untracked new files
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

Review scope: **changes introduced in the current branch since merge-base only**.
Do not review pre-existing architectural problems unless they are directly touched by the diff.

---

## Stack Auto-Detection

When `stack_hint` is not provided, infer from changed file paths:

| Signal | Detected stack |
|--------|---------------|
| `*.module.ts`, `*.controller.ts`, `*.provider.ts`, `@Injectable`, `@Module` | NestJS |
| `*.store.ts`, `makeObservable`, `observable`, `action`, `computed` (MobX) | React + MobX |
| `*.tsx` / `*.jsx` | React (check MVVM boundaries) |
| `prisma/`, `*.repository.ts`, `*.entity.ts` | Backend data layer |
| Mixed signals | fullstack — apply all relevant checks |

---

## Focus Areas and Checklist

### Layer Violations

A **layer violation** occurs when code belonging to one architectural layer is placed in another.
Common layers (adapt to the project's actual layering):

```
UI (View) → ViewModel / Store → Service → Domain → Infrastructure (DB, HTTP)
```

- [ ] API call or HTTP client import inside a React component (should be in store/service)
- [ ] Business logic inside a controller (should be in service/use-case)
- [ ] Database query directly inside a service bypassing the repository layer
- [ ] Domain entity mutating itself with HTTP response data (infrastructure leaking into domain)
- [ ] UI component computing derived state that belongs in a ViewModel or computed property

### Dependency Direction

Dependencies must flow **inward** (from infrastructure toward domain), never outward.

- [ ] Domain module importing from infrastructure (e.g., domain entity importing ORM types)
- [ ] Core/shared module importing from feature module (inverted dependency)
- [ ] Circular import between modules (A imports B, B imports A)
- [ ] Barrel file (`index.ts`) that creates hidden circular references

### Module Boundary Violations

- [ ] Feature A directly accessing feature B's internal service instead of a public API/facade
- [ ] Shared `utils/` or `common/` module containing domain-specific business logic
- [ ] Cross-module data transformation happening in the wrong module

### Design Pattern Misuse

**Repository pattern:**
- [ ] Repository method containing business logic (filtering/transformation beyond simple queries)
- [ ] Service bypassing repository and using ORM/DB client directly
- [ ] Multiple repositories doing the same data transformation independently

**Dependency Injection:**
- [ ] `new SomeService()` inside a class that should receive it via DI
- [ ] Service locator pattern used instead of constructor injection
- [ ] Singleton service holding request-scoped state

**CQRS / Use-case:**
- [ ] Command handler performing a query and returning domain data (mixed responsibility)
- [ ] Use-case importing another use-case (chain via domain events instead)

### SOLID Violations

Focus on **SRP** and **DIP** — the two most commonly violated in practice.

**SRP (Single Responsibility):**
- [ ] Class/module doing two unrelated things (e.g., handles auth AND sends emails)
- [ ] Service with >5 injected dependencies (smell: likely SRP violation)
- [ ] Component rendering UI AND fetching data AND computing derived state

**OCP (Open/Closed):**
- [ ] `switch`/`if-else` chain over a type discriminant that will grow (should be polymorphism or strategy)

**LSP (Liskov Substitution):**
- [ ] Subclass overriding a method with stronger preconditions or weaker postconditions

**ISP (Interface Segregation):**
- [ ] Implementing interface that forces implementing methods never used by this class

**DIP (Dependency Inversion):**
- [ ] High-level module importing a concrete low-level class (should import an abstraction)
- [ ] Infrastructure class passed directly through multiple layers instead of behind an interface

### NestJS-Specific

- [ ] `@Injectable` service used across modules without being exported from its owning module
- [ ] `@Global()` overused — global providers for non-truly-global concerns
- [ ] Circular dependency between NestJS modules without `forwardRef`
- [ ] Provider scope mismatch: `REQUEST`-scoped service injected into `DEFAULT`-scoped service
- [ ] Controller fat with business logic that belongs in the service layer
- [ ] `@Module` imports array including modules it does not need (unnecessary coupling)

### React + MVVM (with MobX)

- [ ] Business logic directly in a component (should be in store action or computed)
- [ ] `useEffect` performing state orchestration that belongs in a MobX reaction or action
- [ ] Store method calling another store's `private` action directly (should go through public API)
- [ ] Component subscribing to raw observable fields instead of using computed/derived values
- [ ] View rendering based on multiple raw observable fields instead of a single computed boolean

### MobX Store Layer

- [ ] `@action` performing async work without wrapping in `runInAction` on resolution
- [ ] `@computed` with side effects (computed must be pure)
- [ ] Observable state mutated outside of an `@action` (MobX strict mode violation)
- [ ] Store importing from another store's internal file instead of its public export
- [ ] Inter-store callback (`onChangeX`, `handleX`, `syncX`) declared `public` when only used internally (should be `private`)

## Orchestrated Review Contract

When dispatched by `review-orchestrator`, follow the provided `reviewer-input.schema.json` payload. Return a `REVIEW_RESULT` object compatible with `skills/review/review-orchestrator/reviewer-finding.schema.json`, then a concise markdown summary. Keep findings evidence-based, include concrete `suggested_fix` for every blocker/major, and return `NEEDS_CONTEXT` instead of guessing when required context is missing.

---

## Finding Format

### Class scope — required for `blocker` and `major`

Every `blocker` and `major` finding must carry `class_scope`: **every** site that
holds the shape you found, and **how you enumerated them** — the grep or query
you ran, or the guard that derives the set.

A finding anchored to one `file:line` is a claim about one site. The recorded
history of this repository is that a fix then repairs that site and leaves its
siblings: one writer of five, one operator instruction of four, six readers of
eight. Each was found by the *next* review round, which is why reviews here have
run to seven and four rounds instead of one.

```yaml
class_scope:
  sites: ["src/lib/shell-config.ts:60", "src/session/store.ts:133"]
  enumeration_method: "grep for the config-path resolvers; 7 writers, 2 unguarded"
```

"I checked the others" is not an enumeration method. A single-entry `sites` list
is a claim that the class has exactly one member — make it deliberately, because
`review-finding.schema.json` accepts it and the next round tests it.

`minor` and `info` may omit it: enumerating the class for every low-severity
observation is theatre, not rigour.

```markdown
### [F-NNN] Title

- **Severity**: blocker | major | minor | info
- **File**: path/to/file.ts:line
- **Problem**: what architectural rule is violated and how
- **Why it matters**: impact on testability / maintainability / correctness
- **Fix**: concrete structural change
- **Patch** (optional):
  ```diff
  - old line
  + new line
  ```
```

Severity comes from **Severity (canonical)** in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md`.
This reviewer keeps no table of its own; what follows is where its recurring
conditions land under that rubric, not a second rubric.

| Condition | Severity | Why, under the canonical rubric |
|---|---|---|
| Circular dependency that fails at runtime (an import resolves to `undefined` on a path the change reaches) | `blocker` | Crash |
| Module scope mismatch that produces wrong data across requests | `blocker` | Data corruption |
| Layer violation — API/IO call in a component, business logic in a controller, domain importing infrastructure | `major` | A named trigger and a named outcome, but structural: not a crash, data loss, vulnerability, or missing acceptance criterion. Identical to `review-frontend`'s rule for the same condition |
| Broken DIP; cross-module coupling with a named consequence | `major` | Same |
| SRP smell with a clear separation path; ISP violation; a component reading several raw observables instead of a computed | `minor` | The code is correct; the cost is to whoever restructures it next |
| Architectural opinion with no named violation | `info` | Shared laws 1 and 2 |

A circular import that resolves cleanly is not a `blocker` — it is `minor`, and
if the concern is purely readability it belongs to `review-style`.

## Iron Laws

### Shared laws (every reviewer)

1. **A claim of runtime harm with no reproducible path is `info`.** If you cannot
   name the input, call, or condition that reaches the code, you have an
   observation, not a finding. Report it as `info` and say what would settle it.
2. **Never flag the theoretical.** The path you describe must exist in the code
   under review. Do not report a safe API because it could be misused, or a
   pattern because it is often wrong elsewhere.
3. **One finding per class, not one per occurrence.** When the same shape appears
   at several sites, report it once and list every site. Ten findings that are one
   finding hide the other nine problems.

Severity levels are defined once, in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md` →
**Severity (canonical)**. This reviewer does not restate them: `blocker` is the
four merge-blocking shapes named there and nothing else, and the `major`/`minor`
boundary is the trigger-and-outcome test.

### Architecture laws

- Only flag actual violations found **in the diff**, not pre-existing issues untouched by the change.
- Every finding MUST cite a specific `file:line` from the diff.
- Architecture opinions without a clear, named violation (layer, SOLID principle, pattern misuse) are `info` only — never `blocker` or `major`.
- Do not flag correct framework usage as a violation just because an alternative exists.

## Job Context Awareness

When dispatched by `review-orchestrator` or `job-orchestrator`, the prompt MAY include:

```
JOB_NAME:     <job-name>
CONTEXT_PATH: .metaproject/jobs/<job-name>/ai/context.md
```

If provided and the file exists, read the context document **before** reviewing the diff.
Use it to:
- Understand which architectural patterns and layers were intentionally chosen
- Avoid flagging deliberate deviations from the default layer model as violations
- Identify framework and library choices that affect what counts as a valid pattern

If absent, proceed normally — context is optional and non-blocking.
When in doubt about whether a pattern was intentional, use `info` severity and note the uncertainty.

---

## Red Flags

| Rationalization | Why it is wrong |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "This class is large, so it must violate SRP" | Size alone is not a violation; cite what two unrelated responsibilities it holds |
| "I see a potential layer violation in a file not in the diff" | Scope is diff-only; pre-existing issues are out of scope unless the diff touches them |
| "This architecture opinion makes things cleaner, so it's a major" | Opinions without a named violation are `info` only |
| "I'll flag every cross-import as a boundary violation" | Not all cross-imports violate boundaries; check whether the dependency direction is correct |
| "The team probably didn't intend this pattern" | Unless the context doc or a clear rule says otherwise, assume intentional; use `info` if unsure |
| "NestJS global module is always wrong" | `@Global()` is a violation only when used for non-global concerns; framework-provided globals are fine |
| "I can't determine if this is wrong without knowing the full architecture" | Use `NEEDS_CONTEXT` status and ask one specific question |
