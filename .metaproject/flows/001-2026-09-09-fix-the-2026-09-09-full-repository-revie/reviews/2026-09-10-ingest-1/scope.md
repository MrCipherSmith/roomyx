# Review Scope

## Stage counts

Stated as counts, never as a precision figure: no precision baseline
exists to improve on (see the flow's baseline.md — 53/53 = 100% by
construction, refused as a baseline).

### Dropped by the pre-filter

not recorded — no pre-filter scope was supplied to this package.
This is NOT `dropped 0`: nothing ran, so nothing is known.

### Refuted by the verifier

verification_mode: annotate
claims_received: 19
claims_applied: 0
claims_rejected: 19
verdicts_capped_to_unverifiable: 0
confirmed: 0
refuted: 0
unverifiable: 0
unverified: 19

### Retained

findings_in: 19
findings_removed_by_verifier: 0
findings_retained: 19

### Verification claims discarded

| finding | reason | why |
|---|---|---|
| <unnamed> | mutation | the claim carried id, reason. A verifier can only delete: it cannot raise a severity, add a finding, or change a finding's text. |

Every discarded claim leaves its finding in place: a claim can cost a verdict, never a finding.


## Caps

Each cap says what it removed, deferred or stopped, with a count. An
absent cap prints `not recorded`, never `0`: a cap that never ran and a
cap that dropped nothing are different facts.

### Findings cap

limit_per_reviewer: 10
findings_seen: 19
findings_retained: 19
findings_truncated: 0
blockers_exempt: 0
reviewers_truncated: 0

_the findings cap ran and truncated nothing_

### Spend ceiling

not recorded — no spend ceiling was evaluated for this package.

### Concurrency cap

not recorded — no dispatch plan was supplied for this package.

## Scope B rejections

not recorded — no blast-radius record reached this ingest, so the scope-B screen
did not run. No finding in this package was raised under scope B; had one been,
the ingest would have been refused rather than recorded unscreened.

## filter_stats

The machine-readable copy is `filter_stats` in `manifest.json`; this block is
rendered from the same record, never re-parsed out of the prose above.
`null` means the stage did not run. It never means `0`.

total: 19
dropped_prefilter: null — no `--scope` was supplied to this ingest. Nothing ran, so nothing is known — this is NOT `dropped 0`.
dropped_low_confidence: null — this pipeline has no confidence threshold: `confidence` is recorded on every finding and no stage filters on it. The field is declared because the roadmap names it, and reports `null` so that a threshold added later cannot be mistaken for one that had always dropped nothing.
dropped_refuted: 0
dropped_scope_b: null — no blast-radius record reached this ingest, so the scope-B screen did not run. `rejected: 0` after a screen that ran is a different fact, and the record keeps them apart.
dropped_findings_cap: 0
dismissed_by_round: null — the round recorded no dismissals channel (`--refuted` was not supplied). This is NOT `dismissed 0`: what survives to findings.json is then the survivors of an unlogged triage, which is why measuring such a corpus returns 100% precision by construction.
retained: 19

### by_reason

_no drop was attributed to a reason; every stage that ran removed nothing_

`dropped_prefilter` counts diff material — whole files and change blocks removed
before any reviewer read them. Every other count is findings, and only those are
summed against `retained`.
