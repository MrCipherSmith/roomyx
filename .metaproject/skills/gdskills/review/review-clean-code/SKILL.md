# Review: Clean Code + SOLID

Specialized reviewer for **Clean Code principles** (Robert C. Martin) and **SOLID** at the
function and class level. Focuses on code in the current branch diff only.

The goal is not stylistic nitpicking — every finding here points to a concrete
maintainability, readability, or extensibility problem that will cause friction
as the codebase grows.

---

## Workflow

```
Clean Code Review Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Read Job Context (if provided)
- [ ] Step 2: Determine git scope (merge-base)
- [ ] Step 3: Collect diff and changed file list
- [ ] Step 4: Meaningful Names check
- [ ] Step 5: Functions check (size, abstraction, arguments)
- [ ] Step 6: Comments check
- [ ] Step 7: Error Handling check
- [ ] Step 8: DRY check
- [ ] Step 9: SOLID check (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP)
- [ ] Step 10: Emit findings in unified format
```

## Input Contract

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `branch` | string | no | Branch to review. Defaults to current branch. |
| `commit_range` | string | no | Explicit hash or range. Overrides merge-base detection. |
| `context_doc` | string | no | Path to job context document. Read before reviewing. |

---

## Scope Detection

See shared script: `skills/shared/git-merge-base.md`

Run the script to determine `BASE_SHA`, then collect the diff:

```bash
git diff --name-status "${BASE_SHA}"
git diff "${BASE_SHA}"
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

Review scope: **only code introduced or modified in this branch since merge-base**.
Pre-existing problems in unchanged lines are out of scope unless a change directly
worsens them.

---

## Iron Laws

### Shared laws (every reviewer)

1. **A claim of runtime harm with no reproducible path is `info`.** If you cannot
   name the input, call, or condition that reaches the code, you have an
   observation, not a finding. Report it as `info` and say what would settle it.
2. **Never flag the theoretical.** The path you describe must exist in the code
   under review. Do not report a safe API because it could be misused, or a
   pattern because it is often wrong elsewhere.
3. **One finding per class, not one per occurrence.** When the same shape appears
   at several sites, report it once and list every site. Ten findings that are one
   finding hide the other nine problems.

Severity levels are defined once, in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md` →
**Severity (canonical)**. This reviewer does not restate them: `blocker` is the
four merge-blocking shapes named there and nothing else, and the `major`/`minor`
boundary is the trigger-and-outcome test.

### Clean Code laws

1. **Findings without a specific `file:line` from the diff are not valid findings.** Never cite general observations about the codebase.
2. **A naming issue is `minor`.** It reaches `major` only when the name has
   already produced an observable wrong outcome at a call site you can name — a
   caller misusing the API because of what it is called. "A future reader might
   misread it" is the maintenance cost that makes it `minor`, not a trigger.
   Naming is never a `blocker`. (`review-style` carries the identical rule.)
3. **DRY violations need at least 3 repetitions before they are worth reporting,
   and they are `minor`.** Two occurrences can be accidental; three is a pattern.
   Duplication is a cost to whoever edits it next, which is `minor` by the
   canonical test — report it once, listing every site, per shared law 3.
4. **SOLID opinions without a named principle and a concrete violation description are `info` only.** State the principle (e.g., SRP), the two responsibilities, and the impact.
5. **Do not flag language idioms or framework conventions as Clean Code violations.** If it is the standard way to do something in TypeScript / NestJS / React, it is not a violation.

## Review Checklist

### Part A: Meaningful Names

The central test: **a name should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used** — without needing a comment to explain it.

#### A1. Intention-Revealing Names

- [ ] Variable / parameter names that require a comment to understand their purpose
- [ ] Single-letter names outside loop counters (`i`, `j`, `k`) and conventional math variables
- [ ] Generic names that carry no information: `data`, `info`, `value`, `temp`, `result`, `obj`, `item`, `thing`, `stuff`, `helper`, `util`, `manager`, `processor`
- [ ] Boolean names that could be read as either true or false: prefer `isLoaded`, `hasError`, `canSubmit` over `loaded`, `error`, `submit`
- [ ] Function names that start with a vague verb: `do`, `handle`, `process`, `manage` — prefer verbs that describe the action: `parseConfig`, `validateToken`, `fetchUserById`

Flags:
- Single-letter variable outside loop — **minor**
- Generic meaningless name (`data`, `result`, `temp`) in new code — **minor**
- Boolean named without `is/has/can/should` prefix making polarity ambiguous — **minor**
- Function named `handleX` where X is also vague — **minor**

#### A2. Searchability and Length

- [ ] Names that are too short to be grepped: single letters or two-letter abbreviations for non-obvious concepts
- [ ] Names that are too long (>40 characters) adding noise without precision: prefer concise + precise over exhaustive
- [ ] Abbreviations that are not project-wide standards (`usr` for `user`, `cnt` for `count`, `cfg` for `config`)

Flags:
- Non-standard abbreviation that a new team member would need to decode — **minor**

#### A3. Consistent Vocabulary

- [ ] Same concept named differently in the same diff: `user` / `account` / `member` used interchangeably for the same domain entity
- [ ] Verb inconsistency for similar actions: `fetch` vs `get` vs `load` vs `retrieve` for the same type of operation in the same module
- [ ] Antonym inconsistency: if one side is `add`, the other should be `remove` — not `delete` / `destroy` / `clear`

Flags:
- Two names for the same concept in the same diff — **minor**

---

### Part B: Functions

#### B1. Function Size and Single Responsibility

Clean Code guideline: functions should do **one thing** at one level of abstraction.

- [ ] Function body exceeds ~20 lines: a strong smell that it does more than one thing
- [ ] Function mixes levels of abstraction: high-level orchestration next to low-level data manipulation in the same block
- [ ] Function that both queries data AND transforms it AND persists it (three responsibilities)
- [ ] Functions with a `And` or `Or` in the name, describing two operations

Flags:
- Function body >40 lines — **major** (clear overload; flag specific function by name)
- Function body 20–40 lines with visible mixed abstraction — **minor**
- `doXAndY()` naming explicitly stating two operations — **minor**

#### B2. Function Arguments

- [ ] Monadic (1 arg): ideal for transformations (`parseDate(str)`) and predicates (`isEmpty(list)`)
- [ ] Dyadic (2 args): acceptable when arguments form a natural ordered pair (`createPoint(x, y)`)
- [ ] Triadic (3 args): consider if a config/options object would read more clearly
- [ ] Polyadic (≥4 args): almost always a sign of a missing abstraction (config object, parameter object, or SRP violation)
- [ ] Boolean flag arguments: `renderWidget(true, false, true)` — split into separate functions or use named option objects
- [ ] Output arguments: a function that mutates its argument instead of returning a value (`populate(result)`)

Flags:
- Function with ≥4 parameters not using an options/config object — **major**
- Boolean flag parameter (`enabled: boolean`) passed to control function flow — **major** (split into two functions)
- Output argument (mutating parameter instead of returning) — **minor**
- Three parameters where a plain named object would be clearer — **minor**

#### B3. Abstraction Level Consistency

Each function should stay at one level of the abstraction ladder. A function that opens a file, reads its bytes, decodes UTF-8, splits lines, and validates each record mixes at least 3 levels.

- [ ] Inline low-level operations (string splitting, index arithmetic) inside a high-level orchestration function
- [ ] High-level domain concepts (`createUserAccount`) containing raw SQL or HTTP fetch calls instead of delegating to a repository/service

Flags:
- High-level function with low-level implementation detail mixed in — **minor**

---

### Part C: Comments

#### C1. Comments That Lie or Are Redundant

- [ ] Comment that repeats what the code already says: `i++ // increment i`
- [ ] Comment that is stale / no longer matches the current code
- [ ] Commented-out code left in the diff

Flags:
- Redundant comment restating the code — **minor**
- Stale comment contradicting the code — **minor** (misleads the next reader; it
  names no runtime trigger, so the canonical rubric puts it here. It was
  **major** in this file until that was reconciled against
  `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md` → **Severity (canonical)**, which reviewers may
  not override. If the comment's inaccuracy *causes* a defect — someone relied on
  it and the code does otherwise — that defect is the finding, at its own severity)
- Commented-out code block — **minor** (use git history, not comments, to preserve old code)

#### C1a. Documentation drift — the shapes worth searching for

Stale comments are not found by reading comments; they are found by reading each
comment **against the statement it sits above**. Three shapes recur, and they are
the cheapest real findings in a multi-round review:

- **A doc describing the rule a later round replaced.** A prop's JSDoc says the
  tooltip drops the split "unless both are known"; the live rule is that both must
  be greater than zero. The behaviour changed, the sentence did not. Check every
  doc comment on every symbol the diff touched, not only the ones the diff edited.
- **A comment detached from its statement.** A `const` gets inserted between a
  comment and the expression it explained, so the comment now reads as an
  explanation of the insertion. The text is unchanged and is now wrong. Look for
  this wherever the diff adds a line inside an existing block.
- **Two files documenting one field oppositely.** One says a cell is the valid
  percentage, another computes `100 - cell` and calls it the invalid percentage.
  Only one is right, and the diff just made the field load-bearing.

Where an issue or PR is cited, check that it is the right one and still says what
the comment claims — a closed *issue* cited in place of the *PR* that shipped the
work sends the next reader to the wrong page.

A comment that describes a behaviour with **no code path at all** — including one
left behind by a review finding that was later withdrawn — is the same class: it
should state the defensiveness it actually provides, not assert a path that does
not exist.

#### C2. Comments That Compensate for Bad Names

A comment whose entire purpose is to explain a poorly-named identifier is a sign to improve the name, not add a comment.

- [ ] `// This is the pipeline execution queue` explaining a variable named `queue2`
- [ ] JSDoc `@param data The data to process` adding zero information

Flags:
- Comment exists only to explain a name that could be made self-documenting — **minor**

#### C3. Comments That Are Justified

These are the correct uses of comments — do NOT flag:
- Legal comments (license headers)
- Explanation of intent for a non-obvious algorithm or business rule
- Clarification of a subtle domain constraint (`// ISO week starts on Monday per business requirement`)
- Warning about consequences (`// Do not cache — response contains time-sensitive token`)
- TODO/FIXME with an issue reference (`// TODO(#1234): remove after migration`)

---

### Part D: Error Handling

#### D1. Error Types and Propagation

- [ ] Returning `null` or `undefined` to signal failure instead of throwing or using a Result type — causes null propagation and eventual NPE
- [ ] Swallowing exceptions: `catch (err) {}` with no logging or re-throw
- [ ] Logging AND re-throwing the same error — double-logs across callers
- [ ] Using error strings instead of typed errors: `throw new Error("NOT_FOUND")` — callers cannot pattern-match
- [ ] `catch (err: any)` — loses type safety; use `catch (err: unknown)`

Flags:
- `catch` block with empty body or only a comment — **major** (silent failure)
- Returning `null` / `undefined` from a function to signal "not found" in a critical path — **major**
- Log + rethrow in the same catch block — **minor**
- Untyped error in catch — **minor**

#### D2. Error Context

- [ ] Re-throwing an error without wrapping context: `throw err` loses the call site information; prefer `throw new AppError("context", { cause: err })`
- [ ] Generic `new Error("something went wrong")` — message must identify what went wrong and ideally what inputs caused it

Flags:
- Bare `throw err` re-throw losing context in a library/service boundary — **minor**
- Generic error message with no context — **minor**

---

### Part E: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

#### E1. Code Duplication

- [ ] Identical or near-identical code blocks in ≥3 places in the diff
- [ ] Copy-pasted logic that differs only in one or two variable names
- [ ] Multiple functions doing the same transformation with slightly different wrapping

Flags:
- 3+ identical or near-identical blocks in the diff that could be extracted — **major**
- 2 occurrences — **minor** (note, do not raise unless the pattern is clearly intentional duplication)

#### E2. Magic Numbers and Strings

- [ ] Hardcoded numeric literal used in business logic with no named constant (`if (status === 3)`)
- [ ] Repeated string literal used as a key, type discriminant, or route path without a shared constant

Flags:
- Magic number in business logic (not an obvious neutral like `0`, `1`, `100`) — **minor**
- Repeated string constant defined inline in multiple places — **minor**

---

### Part F: SOLID (at function/class level)

This overlaps with `review-architecture` at the system level, but here the focus is on
**individual classes and functions**, not module structure or layer assignments.

#### F1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have **one reason to change**: one owner (one part of the system that drives its evolution).

- [ ] Class responsible for both data access AND business logic
- [ ] Class responsible for both input validation AND output formatting
- [ ] A constructor that does real work: making network calls, reading files, computing state — constructors should only assign

Flags:
- Class with two clearly distinct responsibilities that have different change drivers — **major**
- Constructor performing I/O or async operations — **major**
- Service method doing validation + transformation + persistence inline — **minor**

#### F2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. Violations appear as chains that must grow every time a new case is added.

- [ ] `if/else if` or `switch` over a type discriminant that already has 3+ branches — consider a strategy/visitor pattern
- [ ] Adding a case to an existing long `switch` in a file not in the diff context — flag if the diff shows a new `case` in a multi-case switch

Flags:
- New `case` added to a switch with ≥4 existing cases where a strategy pattern would be more appropriate — **minor**
- `instanceof` chain (`if (x instanceof A) ... else if (x instanceof B)`) — **minor**

#### F3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without changing the program's behavior.

- [ ] Subclass `override` method that throws `NotImplementedException` or `UnsupportedOperationException`
- [ ] Subclass method that requires checking `instanceof this` to determine behavior
- [ ] Override that strengthens preconditions (rejects more inputs than the parent)
- [ ] Override that weakens postconditions (returns less than the parent guarantees)

Flags:
- Override throwing "not supported" — **major**
- Override requiring `instanceof` self-check — **major**

#### F4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

- [ ] Interface with ≥7 methods where implementing classes use only a subset — split into smaller interfaces
- [ ] Abstract class method that all concrete subclasses implement as a no-op

Flags:
- Interface with methods that have stub/no-op implementations in subclasses — **minor**

#### F5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) — at class level

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

- [ ] Class instantiating its own dependencies with `new` instead of receiving them via constructor injection
- [ ] Class importing a concrete implementation class from another module instead of an interface/abstract class

Flags:
- `new ConcreteService()` inside a class method that should receive it via DI — **major**
- Import of concrete implementation where an interface or abstract type exists — **minor**

## Orchestrated Review Contract

When dispatched by `review-orchestrator`, follow the provided `reviewer-input.schema.json` payload. Return a `REVIEW_RESULT` object compatible with `skills/review/review-orchestrator/reviewer-finding.schema.json`, then a concise markdown summary. Keep findings evidence-based, include concrete `suggested_fix` for every blocker/major, and return `NEEDS_CONTEXT` instead of guessing when required context is missing.

---

## Finding Format

### Class scope — required for `blocker` and `major`

Every `blocker` and `major` finding must carry `class_scope`: **every** site that
holds the shape you found, and **how you enumerated them** — the grep or query
you ran, or the guard that derives the set.

A finding anchored to one `file:line` is a claim about one site. The recorded
history of this repository is that a fix then repairs that site and leaves its
siblings: one writer of five, one operator instruction of four, six readers of
eight. Each was found by the *next* review round, which is why reviews here have
run to seven and four rounds instead of one.

```yaml
class_scope:
  sites: ["src/lib/shell-config.ts:60", "src/session/store.ts:133"]
  enumeration_method: "grep for the config-path resolvers; 7 writers, 2 unguarded"
```

"I checked the others" is not an enumeration method. A single-entry `sites` list
is a claim that the class has exactly one member — make it deliberately, because
`review-finding.schema.json` accepts it and the next round tests it.

`minor` and `info` may omit it: enumerating the class for every low-severity
observation is theatre, not rigour.

```markdown
### [F-NNN] Title

- **Severity**: blocker | major | minor | info
- **File**: path/to/file.ts:line
- **Principle**: Clean Code — Meaningful Names A1 | SOLID — SRP F1 | etc.
- **Problem**: what is wrong and why it matters
- **Fix**: concrete actionable suggestion
- **Patch** (optional):
  ```diff
  - old line
  + new line
  ```
```

Severity comes from **Severity (canonical)** in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md`.
This reviewer keeps no table of its own; what follows is where its recurring
conditions land under that rubric, not a second rubric.

| Condition | Severity | Why, under the canonical rubric |
|---|---|---|
| Swallowed exception hiding a failed operation | `major` — `blocker` only if the caller then persists or returns wrong data | Same wording as `review-logic`, deliberately. Silent failure is wrong behaviour; corruption is a different shape |
| LSP violation that produces a wrong result or a crash at a named call site | `major`, or `blocker` on the crash/corruption outcome | The outcome decides, not the principle's name |
| Constructor performing I/O | `major` | Named trigger (constructing it) and named outcome (the I/O runs); untestable is not one of the four shapes |
| Function > 40 lines; ≥ 4 parameters without an options object; boolean flag argument; class with two distinct responsibilities; `new ConcreteService()` bypassing DI | `minor` | The code is correct. The cost is to whoever reads or edits it next — that is exactly `minor` |
| Poor naming; redundant comment; magic number; 20–40 line function; OCP/ISP smell; log-and-rethrow | `minor` | Same |
| Stylistic opinion; a future issue with no current violation | `info` | Neither trigger nor a named maintenance cost |

**Clean Code findings are `minor` by default.** A long function with a named
responsibility split is a maintenance cost, not observable wrong behaviour, and
`major` is reserved for findings that name a trigger and an outcome. This
reviewer previously called a 41-line function `major` and thereby forced
`REQUEST_CHANGES` on it; that is the exact mis-ranking the canonical rubric
exists to stop.

## Job Context Awareness

When dispatched by `review-orchestrator` or `job-orchestrator`, the prompt MAY include:

```
JOB_NAME:     <job-name>
CONTEXT_PATH: <JOBS_ROOT>/<job-name>/ai/context.md
```

If provided and the file exists, read the context document before reviewing. Use it to:
- Understand team-agreed naming conventions that may differ from defaults
- Identify intentional design decisions that appear to violate Clean Code but are documented exceptions
- Understand error handling strategy (Result types vs. exceptions vs. null)

If absent, proceed normally — context is optional and non-blocking.

---

## Red Flags

| Rationalization | Why it is wrong |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "This function is long but it's clear" | Clarity and length are separate concerns; long functions are harder to test and change regardless of clarity |
| "The team knows what `data` means here" | Names must survive team turnover; if a newcomer can't understand it, it fails |
| "DRY isn't violated — the two blocks just happen to look the same" | If they change together and must stay in sync, they are a DRY violation |
| "Boolean arg is fine, it's obvious from context" | Boolean args always create `call(true, false, true)` call sites that require reading the signature to decode |
| "The catch block logs the error, that's enough" | Logging and silently swallowing are the same if nothing else handles it — check what happens after the catch |
| "I can flag SOLID issues at info because they're just design opinions" | Named SOLID violations with concrete impact (testability, extensibility) are at least minor |
| "This is how the framework works, so it's not a violation" | Framework idioms are explicitly exempt — Iron Law 5 |
