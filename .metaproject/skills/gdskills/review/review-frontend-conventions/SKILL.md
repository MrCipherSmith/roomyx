  Use when reviewing frontend code against repository-local conventions commonly
  captured in CLAUDE.md or similar project guides: React/MobX boundaries,
  TypeScript strictness, i18n placement, storage wrappers, error handling,
  styling tokens, Storybook expectations, and local tooling rules. Dispatched
  by review-orchestrator for --frontend-conventions, --project-conventions,
  --all, or frontend src/**/*.ts(x) changes when local convention docs exist.

# Review — Frontend Conventions

Reviewer for frontend repository conventions that are more specific than generic React/MobX
correctness. Use it alongside `review-frontend`, `review-style`, `review-performance`, and
`review-logic`.

Before reviewing, read the nearest project guide files if they exist: root `CLAUDE.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, `.junie/guidelines.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and module-level `CLAUDE.md` files.
The checklist below is a neutral baseline; local project rules win when they are stricter.

---

## Scope

Review changed frontend source, stories, tests, and UI wrapper files for local conventions.
Do not flag unrelated generic React/MobX issues unless they also violate a local convention or
the baseline below.

If no local convention document exists, run only the neutral baseline and state that no
project-specific guide was found.

---

## Checklist

### Styling and UI

- Prefer the repository's styling system consistently (Tailwind, CSS modules, design tokens, or
  the established local framework).
- Avoid inline `style` except for genuinely dynamic positioning or third-party integration seams.
- Theme colors and spacing come from local tokens, not ad hoc literals.
- Use the established UI kit and wrapper layer; do not bypass shared wrappers without a reason.
- Reuse existing icons/assets before adding new ones.

### TypeScript

- Avoid `any` and broad `as` casts. Prefer type guards, discriminated unions, and precise types.
- Keep tests and stories typed unless intentionally exercising invalid edge cases.
- Follow local React type import conventions consistently.
- Write new code in the direction of stricter compiler settings.

### React Components

- Keep components thin: read state, bind events, render.
- Business logic, IO, validation, and data transformation belong in stores/services.
- Avoid React local state/memo/callback hooks where the local architecture expects observable or
  computed state.
- Use effects only for lifecycle, subscriptions, and third-party integration; always clean up.
- Components reading observable state are wrapped in the repository's reactive wrapper.
- Props shape and file naming follow local conventions.

### State Stores

- Store classes follow local naming, file casing, context, and hook conventions.
- Observable classes initialize their reactivity in constructors.
- Member ordering follows local lint/member-ordering rules.
- UI-called actions preserve `this` binding.
- Async callbacks that mutate observable state re-enter an action boundary.
- Derived serializable state has a single source of truth such as `currentState` when that is the
  local pattern.

### i18n, Storage, and Errors

- Translations happen at the view/render boundary unless local architecture says otherwise.
- Do not hide missing translations with inline fallbacks when the project expects JSON/catalog
  entries.
- Browser storage goes through shared wrappers/adapters; direct `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`
  access is a review finding when wrappers exist.
- Catch blocks normalize user-facing messages, preserve original errors for logging, and notify
  through the established UI notification channel.

### Stories and Tooling

- New reusable UI surfaces have stories or examples matching local standards.
- Stories include representative default, empty/minimal, and stress/large states where useful.
- Wrapper components expose plain props for controls when the primary component is store-only.
- Treat unused-code tools as signals: preserve intentional public APIs with narrow ignores rather
  than deleting documented runtime/story/test entrypoints.

## Iron Laws

### Shared laws (every reviewer)

1. **A claim of runtime harm with no reproducible path is `info`.** If you cannot
   name the input, call, or condition that reaches the code, you have an
   observation, not a finding. Report it as `info` and say what would settle it.
2. **Never flag the theoretical.** The path you describe must exist in the code
   under review. Do not report a safe API because it could be misused, or a
   pattern because it is often wrong elsewhere.
3. **One finding per class, not one per occurrence.** When the same shape appears
   at several sites, report it once and list every site. Ten findings that are one
   finding hide the other nine problems.

Severity levels are defined once, in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md` →
**Severity (canonical)**. This reviewer does not restate them: `blocker` is the
four merge-blocking shapes named there and nothing else, and the `major`/`minor`
boundary is the trigger-and-outcome test.

---

## Orchestrated Review Contract

When dispatched by `review-orchestrator`, follow the provided `reviewer-input.schema.json` payload. Return a `REVIEW_RESULT` object compatible with `skills/review/review-orchestrator/reviewer-finding.schema.json`, then a concise markdown summary. Keep findings evidence-based, include concrete `suggested_fix` for every blocker/major, and return `NEEDS_CONTEXT` instead of guessing when required context is missing.

---

## Finding Format

### Class scope — required for `blocker` and `major`

Every `blocker` and `major` finding must carry `class_scope`: **every** site that
holds the shape you found, and **how you enumerated them** — the grep or query
you ran, or the guard that derives the set.

A finding anchored to one `file:line` is a claim about one site. The recorded
history of this repository is that a fix then repairs that site and leaves its
siblings: one writer of five, one operator instruction of four, six readers of
eight. Each was found by the *next* review round, which is why reviews here have
run to seven and four rounds instead of one.

```yaml
class_scope:
  sites: ["src/lib/shell-config.ts:60", "src/session/store.ts:133"]
  enumeration_method: "grep for the config-path resolvers; 7 writers, 2 unguarded"
```

"I checked the others" is not an enumeration method. A single-entry `sites` list
is a claim that the class has exactly one member — make it deliberately, because
`review-finding.schema.json` accepts it and the next round tests it.

`minor` and `info` may omit it: enumerating the class for every low-severity
observation is theatre, not rigour.

```markdown
### [F-NNN] Title

- **Severity**: blocker | major | minor | info
- **File**: path/to/file.ts:line
- **Problem**: what local frontend convention is violated
- **Why it matters**: runtime behavior, maintainability, CI, UX, or developer workflow impact
- **Fix**: concrete project-aligned change
```

Severity comes from **Severity (canonical)** in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md`.
This reviewer keeps no rubric of its own; what follows is where its recurring
conditions land under that rubric.

| Condition | Severity | Why, under the canonical rubric |
|---|---|---|
| Unguarded direct storage writes that can throw on quota | `blocker` | Crash on a reachable input |
| Lost reactivity; masked translation or error behaviour | `major` | Named trigger and named outcome. Identical to `review-frontend`'s rating for lost reactivity, deliberately |
| A convention violation the linter or CI already fails on | `minor` | The machine catches it; a reviewer restating it is not a merge gate |
| Naming, story coverage, file placement | `minor` | Correct today; the cost is to the next editor |
| A convention preference with no named consequence | `info` | Shared laws 1 and 2 |
