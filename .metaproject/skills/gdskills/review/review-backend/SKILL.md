# Review — Backend (NestJS / API / DB)

Focused backend reviewer covering NestJS patterns, REST API design, database access patterns,
and TypeScript correctness for service-layer code. This skill does NOT duplicate security or
performance checks — those belong to `review-security-code` and `review-performance`.

## Workflow

```
review-backend Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Read Job Context (if CONTEXT_PATH provided)
- [ ] Step 2: Determine git scope (merge-base) — see skills/shared/git-merge-base.md
- [ ] Step 3: Collect diff and changed file list
- [ ] Step 4: NestJS patterns check
- [ ] Step 5: API design check
- [ ] Step 6: Database patterns check
- [ ] Step 7: TypeScript correctness check
- [ ] Step 8: Emit findings in unified format, sorted by severity
```

## Input Contract

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `branch` | string | no | Branch to review. Defaults to current branch. |
| `commit_range` | string | no | Explicit range (e.g., `abc123..HEAD`). Overrides merge-base detection. |
| `context_doc` | string | no | Path to job context document (e.g., `<JOBS_ROOT>/<job>/ai/context.md`). |
| `issue_url` | string | no | GitHub issue or task URL for spec compliance reference. |

---

## Scope Detection

See shared script: `skills/shared/git-merge-base.md`

Run that script to determine `BASE_SHA` before collecting the diff.

```bash
# Default mode — all changes from merge-base to working tree
git diff --name-only "${BASE_SHA}"
git diff "${BASE_SHA}"

# Explicit range mode
git diff --name-only <FROM_SHA>..<TO_SHA>
git diff <FROM_SHA>..<TO_SHA>
```

Only review files changed in scope. Do not comment on legacy code outside the diff.

## Review Checklist

### 1. NestJS Patterns

**Module structure**
- `@Module()` declaration present; providers, imports, exports are correctly listed
- Circular dependency risk: two modules importing each other — flag as `major` if detected; suggest `forwardRef()`
- Feature modules do not import `AppModule`

**Provider scope**
- Default scope is `Singleton` — correct for stateless services
- `REQUEST`-scoped provider injected into a `Singleton` provider is a **blocker** (creates hidden state sharing)
- `TRANSIENT` scope used unnecessarily when singleton would suffice — flag as `minor`

**DTO validation**
- All controller methods accepting user input (body, query, param) have a DTO class decorated with `class-validator` decorators
- Required fields: `@IsString()`, `@IsNumber()`, `@IsEmail()`, etc. present and accurate
- `@IsOptional()` used only on truly optional fields; non-optional fields must not have `@IsOptional()`
- `ValidationPipe` applied globally (in `main.ts`) or explicitly via `@UsePipes(ValidationPipe)` — **blocker** if missing on any endpoint accepting user input
- `@Transform()` used where input coercion is needed (e.g., string → number from query params)

**Guards and roles**
- Protected endpoints have `@UseGuards(...)` with appropriate guard(s)
- Role-based access uses `@Roles(...)` decorator with a roles guard — missing guard on an endpoint that should be protected is a **blocker**
- Public endpoints explicitly marked with `@Public()` or equivalent decorator, not just left unguarded

**Controller responsibilities**
- Controllers are thin: no business logic, no direct ORM calls, no computation
- Controller methods do: parse input → delegate to service → return response
- If business logic is in a controller method, flag as `major` ("move to service layer")

**Service layer**
- Business logic lives in services
- Services do not directly call the ORM in complex multi-step ways — that belongs in a repository or query object
- Services do not import `Request`/`Response` from HTTP framework (except for streaming or special cases)
- Services declare return types on all public methods

---

### 2. API Design

**HTTP method conventions**
- `GET` requests carry no body (flag as `major` if present)
- `POST` used for resource creation
- `PUT` for full replacement, `PATCH` for partial update — mixed usage without clear reason flagged as `minor`
- `DELETE` on correct resource path

**Response shape consistency**
- All endpoints in a controller return the same envelope shape (e.g., `{ data, meta }`) — inconsistency (sometimes object, sometimes raw array) flagged as `major`
- HTTP status codes match semantics: `201` for create, `200` for read/update, `204` for no-content delete, `404` for not found, `422` for validation failure

**Pagination**
- List endpoints that could return unbounded datasets must have pagination (`limit`/`offset` or `cursor`)
- Missing pagination on a list endpoint flagged as `major` when no obvious bound exists

**Error handling**
- Async controller methods must have error handling: either `try/catch` or a global exception filter
- Unhandled promise rejections (async method without try/catch, no global filter) — **blocker**
- Exception messages must not leak internal details (stack traces, ORM error strings) to the HTTP response — leaking is a **blocker**
- NestJS built-in exceptions (`NotFoundException`, `BadRequestException`, etc.) preferred over generic `Error`

---

### 3. Database Patterns (ORM)

**N+1 queries**
- Relation loaded inside a loop without eager loading (`relations`, `leftJoinAndSelect`) or a DataLoader — **always major**
- Example: `for (const user of users) { user.orders = await orderRepo.find(...) }` — flag with concrete suggestion to use `relations: ['orders']` or batch query

**Transactions**
- Multi-step operations that must be atomic (e.g., create + update + delete across tables) must use a transaction
- Missing transaction on a multi-step mutation is a **major** finding
- NestJS TypeORM: use `dataSource.transaction(async (manager) => { ... })` or `@Transaction()` decorator pattern

**Raw query safety**
- String interpolation in raw queries is a **blocker** (SQL injection risk)
- Use parameterized queries: `query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id])`
- Flag `createQueryBuilder().where('id = ' + id)` as blocker

**Soft deletes**
- If the project schema uses `deletedAt` / `@DeleteDateColumn()`, deletions must use `.softRemove()` / `.softDelete()`, not `.remove()` / `.delete()`
- Hard delete on a soft-delete entity flagged as `major`

**Migration safety**
- Column removed in migration — check that no application code still references it
- Dropping a column without a deprecation period in a live system flagged as `major`
- `NOT NULL` column added without a default value to a populated table — **blocker**

---

### 4. TypeScript Correctness

- No `any` in new code — suggest `unknown` with type guards, or correct typed return
- Public service methods must have explicit return types (`Promise<UserDto>`, not inferred)
- Service contracts expressed as interfaces (`IUserService`), not just class implementations
- No `as any` or unsafe casts (`as unknown as T`) without a comment explaining why
- `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error` without explanation comment — flag as `minor`

  **This is the one severity for this condition, repo-wide.** It was previously
  `minor` here and `major` in `review-strict`, which is deleted. `minor` is what
  the canonical rubric returns: a suppressed compiler error names no trigger and
  no observable wrong outcome — the code does exactly what it did before the
  comment was added. What it costs is the next reader, who cannot tell what was
  suppressed or whether it is still needed. That is the definition of `minor`.
  It becomes `major` only when you can name the input the suppressed error was
  hiding and the wrong value it produces — at which point the finding is about
  that bug, not about the comment.

---

## Iron Laws

### Shared laws (every reviewer)

1. **A claim of runtime harm with no reproducible path is `info`.** If you cannot
   name the input, call, or condition that reaches the code, you have an
   observation, not a finding. Report it as `info` and say what would settle it.
2. **Never flag the theoretical.** The path you describe must exist in the code
   under review. Do not report a safe API because it could be misused, or a
   pattern because it is often wrong elsewhere.
3. **One finding per class, not one per occurrence.** When the same shape appears
   at several sites, report it once and list every site. Ten findings that are one
   finding hide the other nine problems.

Severity levels are defined once, in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md` →
**Severity (canonical)**. This reviewer does not restate them: `blocker` is the
four merge-blocking shapes named there and nothing else, and the `major`/`minor`
boundary is the trigger-and-outcome test.

### Backend conditions

Where this reviewer's recurring conditions land under the canonical rubric. Not a
second rubric — each `blocker` names which of the four merge-blocking shapes it
is, and a condition that cannot name one is not a `blocker`.

| Condition | Severity | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| Missing DTO validation on an endpoint accepting user input | `blocker` | Exploitable vulnerability |
| String interpolation in raw SQL query | `blocker` | Exploitable vulnerability |
| Leaking stack trace / raw ORM error to API response | `blocker` | Exploitable vulnerability (information disclosure) |
| `REQUEST`-scoped provider injected into a `Singleton` | `blocker` | Data corruption — one request's state is served to another |
| Unhandled promise rejection in a controller method | `blocker` | Crash |
| `NOT NULL` column added without a default to a populated table | `blocker` | Data loss — the migration fails or truncates |
| N+1 query (relation loaded in a loop) | `major` (minimum) | Named trigger and outcome; degradation, not an outage. Same rating as `review-highload` |
| Missing transaction on a multi-step atomic mutation | `major` — `blocker` where a partial write corrupts persisted state | The outcome decides |
| Business logic in a controller | `major` | Layer violation. Same rating as `review-architecture` |
| Missing pagination on an unbounded list endpoint | `major` — `blocker` where an attacker-reachable request exhausts memory | Degradation vs. crash/DoS |

## Orchestrated Review Contract

When dispatched by `review-orchestrator`, follow the provided `reviewer-input.schema.json` payload. Return a `REVIEW_RESULT` object compatible with `skills/review/review-orchestrator/reviewer-finding.schema.json`, then a concise markdown summary. Keep findings evidence-based, include concrete `suggested_fix` for every blocker/major, and return `NEEDS_CONTEXT` instead of guessing when required context is missing.

---

## Finding Format

### Class scope — required for `blocker` and `major`

Every `blocker` and `major` finding must carry `class_scope`: **every** site that
holds the shape you found, and **how you enumerated them** — the grep or query
you ran, or the guard that derives the set.

A finding anchored to one `file:line` is a claim about one site. The recorded
history of this repository is that a fix then repairs that site and leaves its
siblings: one writer of five, one operator instruction of four, six readers of
eight. Each was found by the *next* review round, which is why reviews here have
run to seven and four rounds instead of one.

```yaml
class_scope:
  sites: ["src/lib/shell-config.ts:60", "src/session/store.ts:133"]
  enumeration_method: "grep for the config-path resolvers; 7 writers, 2 unguarded"
```

"I checked the others" is not an enumeration method. A single-entry `sites` list
is a claim that the class has exactly one member — make it deliberately, because
`review-finding.schema.json` accepts it and the next round tests it.

`minor` and `info` may omit it: enumerating the class for every low-severity
observation is theatre, not rigour.

```markdown
### [F-001] Title

- **Severity**: blocker | major | minor | info
- **File**: path/to/file.ts:line
- **Problem**: what is wrong
- **Why it matters**: impact on correctness / safety / maintainability
- **Fix**: concrete suggestion
- **Patch** (optional):
  ```diff
  - old line
  + new line
  ```
```

## Output Contract

```
STATUS: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | NEEDS_CONTEXT | BLOCKED
```

- `DONE` — no blockers or majors found
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — one or more blocker or major findings present
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — cannot determine intent without context doc or issue; state what is missing
- `BLOCKED` — cannot access diff or required files; state reason

## Job Context Awareness

When dispatched by `job-orchestrator` or called with an explicit context path, the prompt MAY include:

```
JOB_NAME:     <job-name>
CONTEXT_PATH: <JOBS_ROOT>/<job-name>/ai/context.md
```

If provided and the file exists, read the context document **before** running scope detection.
Use it to understand:
- Which ORM, validation library, or guard strategy was intentionally chosen
- Project-level architectural decisions (e.g., no repository pattern by design)
- Acceptance criteria to verify spec compliance

If absent, proceed normally — context is optional and non-blocking.

## Red Flags

| Rationalization | Why it is wrong |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "ValidationPipe is probably configured somewhere" | Always verify it is applied; assumption lets injection reach service layer |
| "The N+1 only runs on small datasets now" | Data grows; flag it now with a clear fix, not after the incident |
| "The controller has some logic but it's minor" | The line is binary — logic in controller = untestable without HTTP stack |
| "Stack trace in response only shows in dev" | Config can be wrong in prod; treat it as blocker always |
| "I'll skip the migration check — it's just a column rename" | Column renames without fallback break zero-downtime deploys |
