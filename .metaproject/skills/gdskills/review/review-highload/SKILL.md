# Review: High-Load & Scalability

Specialized reviewer for **code that will run under significant concurrent load**.
Focuses on correctness under concurrency, resource contention, back-pressure, failure
modes at scale, and distributed systems invariants — not general performance profiling.

Reviews only changes introduced in the current branch (merge-base to HEAD).

---

## Workflow

```
High-Load Review Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Read Job Context (if provided) — understand expected load profile
- [ ] Step 2: Determine git scope (merge-base)
- [ ] Step 3: Collect diff and changed file list
- [ ] Step 4: Concurrency and race condition check
- [ ] Step 5: Resource management check (connections, threads, file handles, memory)
- [ ] Step 6: Caching and cache invalidation check
- [ ] Step 7: Database access patterns under load
- [ ] Step 8: Async processing and queue patterns
- [ ] Step 9: Retry, timeout, and circuit breaker patterns
- [ ] Step 10: Idempotency and distributed invariants
- [ ] Step 11: Emit findings in unified format
```

## Input Contract

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `branch` | string | no | Branch to review. Defaults to current branch. |
| `commit_range` | string | no | Explicit hash or range. Overrides merge-base detection. |
| `context_doc` | string | no | Path to job context document. Read before reviewing to understand expected RPS, SLA, and load profile. |
| `load_profile` | string | no | Optional hint: expected RPS, concurrent users, or traffic pattern. Adjusts severity of findings. |

---

## Scope Detection

See shared script: `skills/shared/git-merge-base.md`

Run the script to determine `BASE_SHA`, then collect the diff:

```bash
git diff --name-status "${BASE_SHA}"
git diff "${BASE_SHA}"
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

Review scope: **changes introduced in the current branch since merge-base only**.
Pre-existing problems in unchanged lines are out of scope unless the diff makes them worse.

---

## Iron Laws

### Shared laws (every reviewer)

1. **A claim of runtime harm with no reproducible path is `info`.** If you cannot
   name the input, call, or condition that reaches the code, you have an
   observation, not a finding. Report it as `info` and say what would settle it.
2. **Never flag the theoretical.** The path you describe must exist in the code
   under review. Do not report a safe API because it could be misused, or a
   pattern because it is often wrong elsewhere.
3. **One finding per class, not one per occurrence.** When the same shape appears
   at several sites, report it once and list every site. Ten findings that are one
   finding hide the other nine problems.

Severity levels are defined once, in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md` →
**Severity (canonical)**. This reviewer does not restate them: `blocker` is the
four merge-blocking shapes named there and nothing else, and the `major`/`minor`
boundary is the trigger-and-outcome test.

### High-load laws

1. **Every finding states its failure mode: what breaks, and at what load.** "OOM
   at ~1k RPS", "pool exhausted at 500 concurrent users", "duplicate charge on the
   first retry". This is what shared law 1 asks of a load finding — a load level
   is the trigger.
2. **A race condition on shared mutable state is never dismissed as unlikely.**
   "It probably won't happen in practice" is not an argument; races manifest
   unpredictably under load. Its *severity* still comes from its outcome — see the
   conditions table below — but it is never dropped for improbability.
3. **An unbounded resource that grows with request rate is never `minor`.**
   Connections, threads, queues, in-memory collections: under load it exhausts.
4. **Architecture opinions without a named pattern violation and a load-related
   failure mode are `info` only.** State the failure mode, not just that "it could
   be better".

## Review Checklist

### Part A: Concurrency and Race Conditions

#### A1. Shared Mutable State

- [ ] Shared in-memory state (module-level variables, singleton fields, static properties) mutated from concurrent requests without a lock, mutex, or atomic operation
- [ ] Read-modify-write operations on shared counters, maps, or lists not wrapped in an atomic or transaction
- [ ] `Map` / `Set` / plain objects used as in-process caches mutated from concurrent async operations
- [ ] NestJS `DEFAULT`-scoped (singleton) service holding per-request state (e.g., `this.currentUser = ...`)

Flags:
- Singleton service holding mutable per-request state — **blocker**
- Read-modify-write on shared map/counter without atomicity — **blocker**
- Module-level mutable variable mutated from async handlers — **major**

#### A2. Double-Check and TOCTOU

- [ ] Check-then-act patterns where the condition can change between check and action: `if (!exists) insert` without a unique constraint or lock
- [ ] Optimistic upsert without conflict handling (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` with no retry)
- [ ] Token or resource validity checked before use but not at the moment of use (TOCTOU)

Flags:
- Check-then-act on a DB record with no uniqueness enforcement or lock — **blocker**
- Token validity checked only at entry, not at point of use after a long async chain — **major**

#### A3. Async/Await and Concurrency Primitives

- [ ] `Promise.all` used with an unbounded array of promises (can spawn thousands of concurrent operations)
- [ ] `for...of` with `await` inside where `Promise.all` would allow safe parallelism (sequential when parallel is intended)
- [ ] Missing concurrency limit: N parallel jobs where N = input size (use a concurrency limiter / semaphore for unbounded inputs)
- [ ] `async` function swallowing rejection via unhandled `.catch(() => {})` on a fire-and-forget

Flags:
- `Promise.all(items.map(...))` where `items` can be arbitrarily large — **major** (resource exhaustion)
- Fire-and-forget async call with no error handling and no queue backing — **major**
- Missing concurrency cap on parallel operations whose count scales with user input — **major**

---

### Part B: Resource Management

#### B1. Connection Pools

- [ ] Database / Redis / HTTP connection created per request instead of using a shared pool
- [ ] Connection pool size not configured — using default (often 5–10 connections), which will queue at scale
- [ ] Pool exhaustion handling: no timeout on `pool.connect()`, no error boundary — requests will hang silently
- [ ] Connection opened in a function that may throw before `.release()` or `.end()` without a `finally` block

Flags:
- `new Pool()` / `new Client()` / `createConnection()` inside a request handler — **blocker**
- No pool max size configured for a production service — **major**
- Connection acquired without guaranteed release in finally — **major**
- Pool timeout not configured (will queue indefinitely on exhaustion) — **minor**

#### B2. File Handles and Streams

- [ ] File opened with `fs.open` / `fs.createReadStream` without explicit close / destroy on error
- [ ] Readable stream not consumed (memory grows indefinitely until GC or crash)
- [ ] Large file read into memory at once (`fs.readFileSync` / `Buffer.concat` on unknown-size input) — use streams

Flags:
- File handle without guaranteed close — **major**
- `readFileSync` or full `Buffer.concat` on potentially large/user-supplied files — **major**
- Unhandled readable stream accumulating in memory — **major**

#### B3. Memory and Object Allocation

- [ ] Large objects allocated per-request that are not freed between requests
- [ ] In-process cache (plain `Map`) with no eviction policy — grows unboundedly
- [ ] Closure capturing a large object (e.g., full DB result set) in a long-lived data structure

Flags:
- In-process cache `Map` / `Record` with no TTL or max-size eviction — **major**
- Per-request object allocation in a hot path that could be pooled or reused — **minor**

---

### Part C: Caching

#### C1. Cache Invalidation

- [ ] Cache entry updated after a write but not invalidated for related keys (stale reads after update)
- [ ] Cache TTL set to 0 (effectively no caching) or missing on a frequently-read, rarely-written entity
- [ ] Cache key not namespaced — collision between tenants / environments
- [ ] Caching a response that contains per-user data without scoping the key to the user

Flags:
- Cached response containing user-specific data with no user-scoped key — **blocker** (data leak)
- Related cache entries not invalidated after a mutating operation — **major**
- Missing cache key namespace in a multi-tenant or multi-environment system — **major**
- TTL missing or set to a value that is clearly mismatched with data freshness requirements — **minor**

#### C2. Cache Stampede

- [ ] High-traffic key expires simultaneously for many callers — no lock-based or probabilistic early expiry to prevent stampede
- [ ] Thundering herd: cache miss triggers N concurrent DB reads for the same key with no deduplication (e.g., no mutex/semaphore on the first fetch)

Flags:
- Hot key (called >100 RPS) with no stampede protection — **major**
- Cache miss firing N simultaneous DB queries with no in-flight deduplication — **major**

#### C3. Cache Correctness

- [ ] Mutable value stored in cache by reference (not a deep copy) — mutation after storage corrupts the cache
- [ ] Cache key includes non-deterministic components (timestamp, random value, process ID)

Flags:
- Storing a mutable reference in cache (object not serialized/cloned) — **major**
- Non-deterministic cache key — **major**

---

### Part D: Database Access Under Load

#### D1. Missing Indexes

- [ ] Query filtering or ordering by a column not in an index on a large table
- [ ] JOIN on a column that lacks an index on at least one side
- [ ] Unique constraint missing on a column used in uniqueness checks

Flags:
- `WHERE` / `ORDER BY` on an un-indexed column on a high-traffic table — **major**
- Missing unique constraint where the application relies on uniqueness — **blocker**

#### D2. Lock Contention

- [ ] `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on a wide row range — locks more rows than needed
- [ ] Transaction holding a lock while performing external I/O (HTTP call, file read) — lock held far too long
- [ ] Nested transactions with locks — can deadlock under concurrent writers
- [ ] Long-running migration with a full-table lock on a live, high-traffic table

Flags:
- External I/O (HTTP, file) inside a database transaction — **blocker**
- `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` with no LIMIT on a high-traffic table — **major**
- Schema migration adding NOT NULL column without a default on a live table — **major**

#### D3. N+1 and Unbounded Queries

- [ ] Query inside a loop where one batch query would suffice
- [ ] `findAll()` / `SELECT *` on a large table with no LIMIT/pagination
- [ ] Fetching full entity to check a single field

Flags:
- N+1 in a hot path — **major** (also flagged by `review-performance`, noted here for load context)
- Unbounded `findAll()` on a table that grows with usage — **major**
- Fetching full row just to read one column — **minor**

#### D4. Connection and Transaction Hygiene

- [ ] Transaction started but no explicit commit / rollback on all code paths (leak on exception)
- [ ] Long-lived transaction (spans multiple user interactions or HTTP calls)
- [ ] Mixing read replicas and write primary within the same business operation without awareness of replication lag

Flags:
- Transaction with no guaranteed commit/rollback on exception path — **major**
- Replication lag not accounted for (read-your-writes guarantee assumed on replica) — **major**

---

### Part E: Async Processing and Queues

#### E1. Queue Backpressure

- [ ] Producer adding to an in-memory queue with no max depth — under load the queue grows until OOM
- [ ] Consumer not acknowledging/nacking messages — messages redeliver indefinitely on crash
- [ ] Batch consumer with no upper bound on batch size — single batch can take arbitrarily long

Flags:
- Unbounded in-memory queue / channel — **blocker**
- Message consumer missing ack/nack — **major**
- Batch size not capped — **major**

#### E2. Dead Letter and Poison Pills

- [ ] No dead-letter queue for failed messages — poison pills block the consumer indefinitely
- [ ] Retry loop with no maximum retry count — failed message retried forever
- [ ] Consumer crashing on a single malformed message due to missing error handling around deserialization

Flags:
- No DLQ or max retry limit on a message consumer — **major**
- Deserialization error crashing the consumer process — **major**

#### E3. Ordering Guarantees

- [ ] Code assumes FIFO delivery on a queue that does not guarantee ordering (e.g., SQS standard)
- [ ] Parallel consumers writing to shared state where order matters

Flags:
- FIFO assumption on an at-least-once / unordered queue — **major**

---

### Part F: Retry, Timeout, and Circuit Breaker

#### F1. Retry Safety

- [ ] Non-idempotent operation retried without idempotency key (charge, send email, create record)
- [ ] Retry with fixed delay instead of exponential backoff — causes retry storms
- [ ] No maximum retry count — code retries indefinitely
- [ ] Missing jitter on exponential backoff — synchronized retries cause thundering herd

Flags:
- Non-idempotent write retried without idempotency key — **blocker** (data integrity)
- Fixed delay retry or no backoff — **major**
- No max retry count — **major**
- Exponential backoff without jitter — **minor**

#### F2. Timeouts

- [ ] HTTP client / DB call / queue operation with no timeout configured
- [ ] Single timeout for the full chain (outer timeout too long relative to the number of downstream calls)
- [ ] `setTimeout` as a timeout substitute for async operations that do not stop when the timer fires

Flags:
- External call with no timeout — **major**
- Using `setTimeout` as a "give up" timer without actually canceling the operation — **minor**

#### F3. Circuit Breaker

- [ ] Repeated calls to a known-failing downstream without a circuit breaker — floods the downstream and starves the thread pool
- [ ] Fallback returning stale/empty data not documented as intentional degradation

Flags:
- Unbounded retries to a failing downstream without circuit breaker — **major**
- No fallback or graceful degradation when downstream is unavailable — **minor**

---

### Part G: Idempotency and Distributed Invariants

#### G1. Idempotency

- [ ] Webhook / event handler has no deduplication — processing the same event twice produces duplicate side effects
- [ ] API endpoint that creates a resource not accepting or generating an idempotency key
- [ ] Distributed cron/scheduled job running on multiple instances simultaneously with no distributed lock

Flags:
- Event handler with no deduplication and non-idempotent side effects — **blocker**
- Distributed cron with no leader election or distributed lock — **blocker**
- Resource creation endpoint with no idempotency key support — **major**

#### G2. Distributed Consistency

- [ ] Assumption that two sequential operations form an atomic unit without a transaction or saga
- [ ] Cross-service write sequence with no compensation logic on partial failure
- [ ] Relying on eventual consistency while assuming immediate consistency (reading from cache/replica right after writing)

Flags:
- Multi-step cross-service operation with no rollback / saga — **major**
- Assumed immediate consistency where eventual consistency is the actual guarantee — **major**

#### G3. Clock and ID Assumptions

- [ ] Using `Date.now()` or `new Date()` for ordering events across distributed nodes — clocks drift
- [ ] Auto-increment integer IDs expected to be globally unique across sharded databases
- [ ] UUID v1 (time-based, exposable MAC address) used where UUID v4 (random) is safer

Flags:
- Event ordering based on wall-clock time in a distributed context — **major**
- Assumption of globally unique sequential IDs across shards — **major**

## Orchestrated Review Contract

When dispatched by `review-orchestrator`, follow the provided `reviewer-input.schema.json` payload. Return a `REVIEW_RESULT` object compatible with `skills/review/review-orchestrator/reviewer-finding.schema.json`, then a concise markdown summary. Keep findings evidence-based, include concrete `suggested_fix` for every blocker/major, and return `NEEDS_CONTEXT` instead of guessing when required context is missing.

---

## Finding Format

### Class scope — required for `blocker` and `major`

Every `blocker` and `major` finding must carry `class_scope`: **every** site that
holds the shape you found, and **how you enumerated them** — the grep or query
you ran, or the guard that derives the set.

A finding anchored to one `file:line` is a claim about one site. The recorded
history of this repository is that a fix then repairs that site and leaves its
siblings: one writer of five, one operator instruction of four, six readers of
eight. Each was found by the *next* review round, which is why reviews here have
run to seven and four rounds instead of one.

```yaml
class_scope:
  sites: ["src/lib/shell-config.ts:60", "src/session/store.ts:133"]
  enumeration_method: "grep for the config-path resolvers; 7 writers, 2 unguarded"
```

"I checked the others" is not an enumeration method. A single-entry `sites` list
is a claim that the class has exactly one member — make it deliberately, because
`review-finding.schema.json` accepts it and the next round tests it.

`minor` and `info` may omit it: enumerating the class for every low-severity
observation is theatre, not rigour.

```markdown
### [F-NNN] Title

- **Severity**: blocker | major | minor | info
- **File**: path/to/file.ts:line
- **Pattern**: Concurrency A1 — Shared Mutable State | Resource B1 — Connection Pool | etc.
- **Failure mode**: what specifically breaks under load and at what scale
- **Fix**: concrete change with reference pattern (exponential backoff, connection pool, distributed lock, etc.)
- **Patch** (optional): unified diff
```

The **Failure mode** line is mandatory for this reviewer — every finding must state the load-related consequence (OOM at 1k RPS, connection exhaustion at 500 concurrent users, duplicate charges on retry, etc.).

Severity comes from **Severity (canonical)** in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md`.
This reviewer keeps no table of its own; what follows is where its recurring
conditions land under that rubric, not a second rubric.

| Condition | Severity | Why, under the canonical rubric |
|---|---|---|
| Race condition on shared mutable state | `blocker` **if** the interleaving can corrupt or lose data; otherwise `major` | Same wording as `review-logic`, deliberately: the outcome decides, not the word "race" |
| Non-idempotent retry of an operation with side effects | `blocker` | A retried write duplicates or corrupts persisted state |
| Unbounded in-memory queue or collection growing with request rate | `blocker` | OOM is a crash; state the rate that reaches it |
| Distributed cron or job with no lock | `blocker` | Concurrent runs duplicate side effects |
| Transaction held open across external I/O | `blocker` | Pool exhaustion takes the service down |
| Blocking I/O on a thread or fiber shared with the event loop | `major` | Named trigger: a request served on that thread. Named outcome: every concurrent request on it stalls behind the one slow call. Restored — the per-reviewer rubric that carried this floor was deleted and the conditions table did not pick it up, leaving the skill's own description advertising hot-path blocking I/O with no rule assigning it a severity |
| Connection without a pool; unbounded `Promise.all`; missing retry timeout or backoff; cache stampede on a hot key; N+1 on a hot path; long transaction; missing DLQ | `major` | Named trigger (a load level) and named outcome, but the outcome is degradation, not one of the four shapes |
| Backoff without jitter; TTL misconfigured; per-request allocation on a hot path; full-row fetch for one field | `minor` | Correct under load; the cost is to whoever tunes it next |
| Architectural note with no failure mode at a stated load | `info` | Shared law 1 |

## Job Context Awareness

When dispatched by `review-orchestrator` or `job-orchestrator`, the prompt MAY include:

```
JOB_NAME:     <job-name>
CONTEXT_PATH: <JOBS_ROOT>/<job-name>/ai/context.md
```

If provided and the file exists, read the context document before reviewing. Use it to:
- Understand the expected traffic profile (RPS, concurrent users, burst patterns)
- Know the infrastructure constraints (pool sizes, queue limits, replica topology)
- Identify intentional trade-offs already accepted (eventual consistency, at-least-once delivery)
- Avoid flagging documented acceptable degradation paths as violations

If absent, proceed normally — context is optional and non-blocking.
When load profile is unknown, note in findings that severity assumes "moderate-to-high traffic".

---

## Red Flags

| Rationalization | Why it is wrong |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "We don't have high traffic yet, so this is fine" | Correctness under concurrency does not depend on current traffic; a race condition exists at 1 RPS too |
| "The connection pool defaults are probably fine" | Default pools (5–10 connections) queue at a few hundred concurrent users; always verify |
| "Retrying this is safe because it's idempotent" | Verify it actually is — most `POST` endpoints are not idempotent by default |
| "We'll add a circuit breaker later" | "Later" is when the downstream is down; flag as minor now to create the record |
| "The cache invalidation is handled somewhere else" | "Somewhere else" means it will be missed — flag where the write happens with no corresponding invalidation |
| "This runs in a queue so race conditions don't apply" | Multiple consumer instances still race on shared DB rows unless explicitly serialized |
| "Using Date.now() for ordering is fine" | Clock skew across nodes makes wall-clock ordering unreliable; use logical clocks or DB sequences |
